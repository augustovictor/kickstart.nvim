> You're an nvim and obsidian and obisidian.nvim 
(https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim) expert 

⏺ Great! I'm ready to help you with Neovim, Obsidian, and obsidian.nvim
  configuration and usage. I can see you already have obsidian.nvim
  installed based on your recent commits.

  What would you like help with? For example:
  - Configuring obsidian.nvim features
  - Setting up note-taking workflows
  - Creating custom keybindings
  - Troubleshooting issues
  - Optimizing your setup
  - Understanding specific features

  Feel free to ask me anything about your Neovim/Obsidian setup!

> It seems like I don't have a templates folder for my obsidian 

⏺ Let me check your obsidian.nvim configuration to see how templates are set
   up.

⏺ Search(pattern: "obsidian")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Read(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Read 231 lines

⏺ I can see your obsidian.nvim configuration has the templates folder set to
   'templates' on line 153, which means it expects templates at:

  /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/AAAGitVault/templates

  Let me check if this folder exists:

⏺ Bash(ls -la "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/AAAGitVault" | grep
       -E "^d.*templates")
  ⎿  No matches found

⏺ The templates folder doesn't exist. Would you like me to:

  1. Create the templates folder at /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian 
  Vault/AAAGitVault/templates
  2. Create some starter templates (e.g., a default note template, meeting
  notes template, etc.)
  3. Add a template command to your obsidian.nvim keybindings for easy
  template insertion

  Let me know which you'd prefer, or I can do all three!

> go ahead 

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/templates")
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let me create some useful starter templates:

⏺ Bash(cat > "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/templates/default.md" << 'EOF'
      ---…)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(cat > "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/templates/meeting.md" << 'EOF'
      ---…)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(cat > "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/templates/daily.md" << 'EOF'
      ---…)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let me add the template command to your keybindings:

⏺ Update(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Tool use rejected with user message: I don't want a keybinding to create a 
     template

⏺ Perfect! I've created the templates folder and added three starter
  templates for you:

  1. default.md - A general-purpose note template with sections for
  overview, notes, and references
  2. meeting.md - Meeting notes template with attendees, agenda, discussion,
   and action items
  3. daily.md - Daily note template with goals, notes, reflections, and
  tomorrow's plan

  All templates are located at:
  /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/AAAGitVault/templates/

  You can use them with the :ObsidianTemplate command in Neovim when you're
  editing a note. The templates support variables like {{title}}, {{date}},
  and {{time}} which obsidian.nvim will automatically fill in based on your
  configuration.

  Feel free to modify these templates or create new ones as needed!

> I want to have an extra vault for work. One that's outside of AAAGitVault 
(which i'm tracking with my personal git). The one for work shouldn't be 
tracked by git. 

⏺ I'll help you set up a separate work vault in your obsidian.nvim
  configuration. Let me update the workspaces configuration to include both
  your personal and work vaults.

⏺ First, let me ask you: where would you like the work vault to be located?
  For example:
  - /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/WorkVault
  - /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Work
  - Some other location?

> Under the first 

⏺ Perfect! Let me update your obsidian.nvim configuration to add the work
  vault and then create the directory structure.

⏺ Update(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Updated lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua with 4 additions        
       70            name = 'personal',
       71            path = '/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian 
            Vault/AAAGitVault',
       72          },
       73 +        {
       74 +          name = 'work',
       75 +          path = '/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian 
          + Vault/WorkVault',
       76 +        },
       77        },
       78    
       79        notes_subdir = 'notes',

⏺ Now let me create the work vault directory structure with the same
  folders:

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/WorkVault"/{notes/dailies,templates,assets/imgs})
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me also copy the templates to your work vault:

⏺ Bash(cp "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/templates/"*.md "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
       Vault/WorkVault/templates/")
  ⎿ Tool use rejected with user message: Is it possible to use the templates 
    from the previous templates created on my personal vault?

⏺ Yes! obsidian.nvim will use the templates from whichever workspace you're
  currently in. So you have two options:

  1. Share templates between vaults - Create symbolic links so both vaults
  use the same templates
  2. Keep templates separate - Each vault has its own templates folder
  (useful if work templates need different structure)

  Would you like me to set up symbolic links so both vaults share the same
  templates from your personal vault? This way you only need to maintain one
   set of templates.

> I want the work templates to extend the ones on my personal. Work vault 
should have it's own, but I also want to be able to leverage my personal 
ones when adding pages to work vault 

⏺ That's a great approach! Unfortunately, obsidian.nvim's templates.folder
  configuration only supports a single folder path per workspace, so it
  can't natively look in multiple locations.

  However, I can set up a solution where:
  1. Your work vault has its own templates/ folder for work-specific
  templates
  2. We create symbolic links in the work templates folder that point to
  your personal templates
  3. This way, both work-specific AND personal templates will appear when
  you run :ObsidianTemplate in your work vault

  Let me set this up:

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/WorkVault/templates")
  ⎿ Tool use rejected with user message: Let me ask something before we proceed.
     As long as when i'm creating a new page on a vault i'm able to select from 
    the templates on my personal vault, I'm fine. i.e., the personal vault 
    templates should be the only ones, but when I'm creating a new page I want 
    to select among them, and save the new page on the work vault, for example.


⏺ Ah, I understand! You want ONE shared templates folder that both vaults
  can use. Let me update the configuration so both workspaces point to the
  same templates folder (your personal vault's templates):

⏺ Update(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Updated lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua with 5 additions        
       73          {
       74            name = 'work',
       75            path = '/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian 
            Vault/WorkVault',
       76 +          overrides = {
       77 +            templates = {
       78 +              folder = 
          + '/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian 
          + Vault/AAAGitVault/templates',
       79 +            },
       80 +          },
       81          },
       82        },
       83    

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/WorkVault"/{notes/dailies,assets/imgs})
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Perfect! I've set up your work vault with shared templates. Here's what I
  did:

  1. Added the work workspace to your obsidian.nvim config at
  /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/WorkVault
  2. Configured template sharing using the overrides option - your work
  vault will use the templates from your personal vault
  3. Created the work vault directory structure with notes/dailies and
  assets/imgs folders

  Now when you:
  - Open a file in your work vault, you can use :ObsidianTemplate and select
   from your personal vault's templates
  - The new note will be saved in the work vault
  - You maintain one set of templates in your personal vault (which is
  git-tracked)
  - Your work vault remains separate and untracked by git

  To switch between vaults, you can use the command :ObsidianWorkspace and
  select either "personal" or "work".

> Add a keybinding for it 

⏺ Update(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Updated lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua with 3 additions

       23              '[l] Follow Link',
       24 +            '[w] Switch Workspace',
       25            }, {
       26              prompt = 'Obsidian:',
       27              format_item = function(item)
     ...
       43                  require('obsidian').util.toggle_checkbox()
       44                end,
       45                ['[l] Follow Link'] = 'ObsidianFollowLink',
       46 +              ['[w] Switch Workspace'] = 'ObsidianWorkspace',
       47              }
       48              local cmd = commands[choice]
       49              if type(cmd) == 'function' then
     ...
       63        { '<leader>om', '<cmd>ObsidianTomorrow<cr>', desc = 
            'Obsidian: To[m]orrow' },
       64        { '<leader>oo', '<cmd>ObsidianOpen<cr>', desc = 
            'Obsidian: [O]pen in app' },
       65        { '<leader>op', '<cmd>ObsidianPasteImg<cr>', desc = 
            'Obsidian: [P]aste Image' },
       66 +      { '<leader>ow', '<cmd>ObsidianWorkspace<cr>', desc = 
          + 'Obsidian: Switch [W]orkspace' },
       67      },
       68      opts = {
       69        workspaces = {

⏺ Perfect! I've added the workspace switching keybinding. Now you can:

  - Press <leader>ow to directly switch workspaces
  - Or press <leader>o and select [w] Switch Workspace from the menu

  This will let you quickly toggle between your personal and work vaults!

> Nice. Now fix the template folders references on the plugin config 

⏺ Looking at the configuration, I can see the issue. The personal vault is
  using a relative path 'templates' while the work vault is using an
  absolute path. Let me fix this to be consistent:

⏺ Update(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Updated lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua with 6 additions and 1 removal
       72          {
       73            name = 'personal',
       74            path = '/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian 
            Vault/AAAGitVault',
       75 +          overrides = {
       76 +            templates = {
       77 +              folder = 
          + '/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian 
          + Vault/AAAGitVault/templates',
       78 +            },
       79 +          },
       80          },
       81          {
       82            name = 'work',
     ...
       161          return out
       162        end,
       163    
       164 +      -- Default templates config (can be overridden per 
           + workspace)
       165        templates = {
       166 -        folder = 'templates',
       166          date_format = '%Y-%m-%d',
       167          time_format = '%H:%M',
       168        },

⏺ Perfect! I've fixed the template folder references. Now:

  1. Both workspaces explicitly specify the templates folder using absolute
  paths in their overrides
  2. Both point to the same location:
  /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/AAAGitVault/templates
  3. The global templates config now only contains date_format and
  time_format (removed the folder key since it's defined per workspace)

  This ensures both vaults will consistently use the shared templates from
  your personal vault, and it's clear and explicit in the configuration.

> Nice. Now let's work on the keybindings for the daily notes. 

⏺ Let me check the current daily notes keybindings:

⏺ Read(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines

⏺ I can see you already have keybindings for daily notes:
  - <leader>ot - Today
  - <leader>oy - Yesterday
  - <leader>om - Tomorrow

  What changes would you like to make to these keybindings? For example:
  - Different key combinations?
  - Add more daily note navigation (like next/previous day)?
  - Change the mnemonic letters?
  - Something else?

> I want a daily-work template that merges the meeting and daily templates 
in an effective and efficient manner. That will be like my daily journal for
 work. When creating daily notes they should be added to the respective 
vault 

⏺ Let me create a daily-work template that combines the best of both:

⏺ Bash(cat > "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/templates/daily-work.md" << 'EOF'
      ---…)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let me configure the work vault to automatically use this template for
   daily notes:

⏺ Update(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Updated lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua with 7 additions     
       85              templates = {
       86                folder = 
            '/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian 
            Vault/AAAGitVault/templates',
       87              },
       88 +            daily_notes = {
       89 +              folder = 'notes/dailies',
       90 +              date_format = '%Y-%m-%d',
       91 +              alias_format = '%B %-d, %Y',
       92 +              default_tags = { 'daily-notes', 'work' },
       93 +              template = 'daily-work.md',
       94 +            },
       95            },
       96          },
       97        },

⏺ Perfect! I've set everything up:

  1. Created daily-work.md template that combines:
    - Daily goals and priorities (from daily template)
    - Meeting sections with time, attendees, notes, and action items (from
  meeting template)
    - Tasks & Progress tracking
    - Notes & Observations section
    - Blockers/Issues section
    - Tomorrow's priorities
  2. Configured the work vault to automatically use this template when you
  create daily notes:
    - When in the work vault: daily notes (<leader>ot, <leader>oy,
  <leader>om) will use the daily-work.md template
    - When in the personal vault: daily notes will use the default structure
   (no template)
    - Daily notes are saved to notes/dailies in the respective vault

  Now when you switch to your work vault (<leader>ow) and create a daily
  note (<leader>ot), it will automatically use the work journal template!

> Remove obsolete templates 

⏺ Bash(ls -la "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/templates/")
  ⎿ Tool use rejected with user message: Isn't that my existing templates 
    folder?

⏺ Yes, exactly! That's your templates folder where we created the templates
  earlier. Which templates would you like me to remove? We currently have:
  - default.md
  - meeting.md
  - daily.md
  - daily-work.md (the new one)

  Since you now have daily-work.md that combines meeting and daily, would
  you like me to remove meeting.md and daily.md, keeping only default.md and
   daily-work.md?

> Just remove the ones you merged into daily-work 

⏺ Bash(rm "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/templates/meeting.md"
      "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/templates/daily.m…)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Done! I've removed meeting.md and daily.md. You now have:
  - default.md - General-purpose note template
  - daily-work.md - Your work journal template

> The daily-work should be de default for work vault. And the personal one 
doesn't need 'references' 

⏺ Update(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Updated lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua with 1 addition
       84            overrides = {

       88              },
       89              daily_notes = {
       90                folder = 'notes/dailies',

       12    ## Notes
       13    
       14 -  
       15 -  ## References
       16 -  

⏺ Perfect! I've made both changes:

  1. Set daily-work.md as the default template for work vault - When you
  create a new note in the work vault, it will automatically use the
  daily-work template
  2. Removed the References section from the default template - Now it only
  has Overview and Notes sections

  Your template setup is now complete and streamlined!

> Daily notes should be stored under _ME/daily for personal vault and under 
daily for work vault 

⏺ Update(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Updated lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua with 7 additions and 1 removal
       76              templates = {

       93                default_tags = { 'daily-notes', 'work' },

⏺ Now let me create those directories:

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/AAAGitVault/_ME/daily" "/Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian
      Vault/WorkVault/daily")
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Perfect! I've updated the daily notes configuration:

  - Personal vault: Daily notes will be saved to _ME/daily/
  - Work vault: Daily notes will be saved to daily/

  Both directories have been created. Now when you use <leader>ot,
  <leader>oy, or <leader>om, the daily notes will be stored in the correct
  location based on which vault you're in!

> Sorry, the personal daily notes should be under the personal vault, 
_ME/daily 

⏺ I believe that's already correct! Let me verify the configuration:

⏺ Read(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines

⏺ Yes, it's already set up correctly! The personal vault configuration
  shows:
  - Path: /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/AAAGitVault
  - Daily notes folder: _ME/daily (relative to the vault path)

  So your personal daily notes will be stored at:
  /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/AAAGitVault/_ME/daily/

  And I already created that directory. Everything is configured as you
  requested!

> And for work daily notes it should be under the work vault daily 

⏺ Yes, that's also already correct! Let me verify:

⏺ Read(lua/custom/plugins/obsidian.lua)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines

⏺ Perfect! The work vault is also configured correctly:
  - Path: /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/WorkVault
  - Daily notes folder: daily (relative to the vault path)

  So your work daily notes will be stored at:
  /Users/victoraugusto/Documents/Obsidian Vault/WorkVault/daily/

  Both directories have already been created. Everything is set up as you
  requested! When you switch workspaces and create daily notes, they'll go
  to their respective vault's daily folder.
